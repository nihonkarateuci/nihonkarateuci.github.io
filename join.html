                    <h3>What is karate?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Karate is an umbrella term for striking martial arts originating from Japan.
                        The word "karate" translates to "empty hand", referring to the employment of
                        various kicking, hand, elbow, and knee techniques as opposed to weaponry. 
                        The specific style NKC trains under is <span style="color:#a0181f;">Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773;</span>,
                        one of the six original schools recognized by Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (the first
                        government sanctioned martial arts organization in Japan) in the 1930s. In addition
                        to the standard striking techniques used in most other karate styles, 
                        <span style="color:#a0181f;">Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773;</span> draws influence
                        from jujitsu, aikido, and kendo. It is politically manifested by the Japan 
                        Karate-do&#773; Ryobu-Kai organization, with branches in 23 countries around the world.

                    <h3>How do I join?</h3>
                    <p>
                        NKC membership is limited to current UCI students. To sign up, you'll first
                        have to make a Club Sports account with the ARC. Follow this
                        <a href="https://www.campusrec.uci.edu/club/join.asp">link</a> for more details.
                        In general, you'll have to pay a yearly $15 Club Sports registration fee and
                        complete a concussion baseline test (if you do not have one on record with
                        the ARC already). After that, club membership consists of a quarterly $10
                        fee to cover tournament, travel, and equipment fees.
                    </p>
                    <h3>I'm not sure about this whole karate thing...</h3>
                    <p>
                        Don't worry, we've all been there. If you're still on the fence, 
                        then we'd recommend dropping by one of our Thursday practices.
                        They're at the ARC in the Activity Annex, from 7:30-9:00pm.
                        You don't need a gi, but make sure to bring something you can work out in.
                    </p>
