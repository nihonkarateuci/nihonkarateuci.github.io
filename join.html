                </p>
                <h3><b>What is karate?</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Karate (<span lang="ja" title="Japanese language text">空手</span>) is an umbrella term for striking martial arts originating from Japan. The word "karate" translates
                    to "empty hand", referring to the employment of various kicking, hand, elbow, and knee techniques as opposed to weaponry.
                    The specific style NKC trains under is Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773;, one of the six original schools recognized by Dai Nippon Butoku
                    Kai (the first government sanctioned martial arts organization in Japan) in the 1930s. In addition to the standard striking
                    techniques used in most other karate styles, Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773; draws influence from jujitsu, aikido, and kendo.
                </p>
                <h3><b>What do you do in karate?</b></h3>
                <p>
                    We mainly do three types of training: kihon, kata, and kumite. Kihon is a term meaning
                    "basics" or "fundamentals" and we practice the essential techniques of karate such as stances,
                    punches, kicks, block, etc. Kata means "way of doing" and we learn a series of movements and techniques
                    that simulates a real fight. Last but not least, kumite means "sparring" and this is when we execute our
                    live knowledge in engaging an opponent with what we have learned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    NKC membership is limited to current UCI students and staff. Brief registration instructions can be found below. A more detailed
                  	guide, with pictures, is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CzBj1MOwM-MhXhoPqt6PvZVAnEFFMfWE5F7t4nYe1g0/edit#slide=id.g64a679eee9_1_0">here!</a>

                        <li>
                            NKC is part of the UCI Club Sports program, so the first step of our registration process is making a DoSportsEasy (DSE)
                            account with UCI Campus Recreation, which oversees Club Sports. You can make an account <a href="https://hdc-p-ols.spectrumng.net/ucirvine/Login.aspx?isKiosk=False">here!</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once you’ve made an account, please fill out the DSE registration. This will include entering some personal information,
                            as well as paying the annual $15 Club Sports fee that supports the club sports organization. Keep in mind this process will
                            enable you to join ANY club sport, not just NKC.

                        </li>
                    	<li>
                        	This is the final step! Our club collects its own club dues to provide members with a number of benefits, including
                            sponsorship for gi purchases, payment tournament registration fees, carpools to practices and events, sparring equipment
                            for practices, and more! Our dues are $15 a quarter, or $40 for the entire year.
