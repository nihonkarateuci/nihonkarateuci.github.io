                    <h3><b>What is karate?</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        Karate is an umbrella term for striking martial arts originating from Japan.
                        The word "karate" translates to "empty hand", referring to the employment of
                        various kicking, hand, elbow, and knee techniques as opposed to weaponry.
                        The specific style NKC trains under is <span style="color:#a0181f;">Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773;</span>,
                        one of the six original schools recognized by Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (the first
                        government sanctioned martial arts organization in Japan) in the 1930s. In addition
                        to the standard striking techniques used in most other karate styles,
                        <span style="color:#a0181f;">Shindo&#773; jinen-ryu&#773;</span> draws influence
                        from jujitsu, aikido, and kendo. It is politically manifested by the Japan
                        Karate-do&#773; Ryobu-Kai organization, with branches in 23 countries around the world.
                    </p>
                    <h3><b>What do you do in karate?</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        We mainly do three types of training: kihon, kata, and kumite. Kihon is a term meaning
                        "basics" or "fundamentals" and we practice the essential techniques of karate such as stances,
                        punches, kicks, block, etc. Kata means “way of doing” and we learn a series of movements and techniques
                        that simulates a real fight. Last but not least, kumite means “sparring” and this is when we execute our
                        live knowledge in engaging an opponent with what we have learned.
                    </p>

                    <h3><strong>Covid-19 Update:</strong></h3>
                    <p><strong>
                      In order to ensure our members’ safety, we are no longer conducting an in-person
                      training session. Instead, we are using an application called Zoom and have our
                      Sensei or Senpai teach us online. Our current schedule is Wednesday 18:00-19:00
                      and Saturday 10:00-11:00 and 13:00-14:30. Anyone is welcome to join, and feel
                      free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:karate@uci.edu">karate@uci.edu</a> for more information.

                    <p>
                        For Fall quarter, the $10 fee will not be required because we will host training online.
                        For upcoming quarters if karate training is in person, then the $10 will be required.
                    </p>

                    <h3><b>How do I join?</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        NKC membership is limited to current UCI students. To sign up, you'll first
                        have to make a Club Sports account with the ARC. Follow this
                        <a href="https://www.campusrec.uci.edu/club/join.asp">link</a> for more details.
                        In general, you'll have to pay a yearly $15 Club Sports registration fee and
                        complete a concussion baseline test (if you do not have one on record with
                        the ARC already). After that, club membership consists of a quarterly $10
                        fee to cover tournament, travel, and equipment fees.

                    <p><strong>
                      In order to ensure our members’ safety, we are no longer conducting an in-person
                      training session. Instead, we are using an application called Zoom and have our
                      Sensei or Senpai teach us online. Our current schedule is Wednesday 18:00-19:00
                      and Saturday 10:00-11:00 and 13:00-14:30. Anyone is welcome to join, and feel
                      free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:karate@uci.edu">karate@uci.edu</a> for more information.

                    <h3><b>I'm not sure about this whole karate thing...</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        Don't worry, we've all been there. If you're still on the fence,
                        then we'd recommend dropping by one of our Thursday practices.
                        They're at the ARC in the Activity Annex, from 7:30-9:00pm.
                        You don't need a gi, but make sure to bring something you can work out in.
                    </p>
