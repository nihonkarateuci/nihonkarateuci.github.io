                                During my university years I had the opportunity to travel to Japan
                                and train at the honbu dojo of JKA and received instruction from Kurihara Kazuaki,
                                Naka Tatsuya, Kunio Kobayashi, and other great senseis.

                                I started Shotokan Karate back in 1999 in Brittany, France, attracted by my father's old VHS of combat training.
                                After getting my black belt I realized that I was just getting started, and that there would never be an ending to improving my karate.
                                This aspect of karate is extremely humbling and exciting to me as there will always be more to do, to learn.
                                Having the chance to teach karate to young kids for 4 years was extremely rewarding to be able to pass on skills and see the growth in them.
                                Moving to different places and country and being curious, I broadened my martial arts practice with jotaikido jutsu and systema.
                                Arriving here in Irvine, I was extremely happy to find Sensei Bruce and discovering the practice of Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773;.
                                Having recently got a 2nd Dan I am looking forward to dive deeper into this style and share my passion with new practitioners.

                                I started training as a white belt when I began college at UC Irvine in 2010,
                                and now I have a 1st degree black belt with Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; Karate.
                                When I was a child, I took a month of karate lessons.
                                I always wanted to continue, but never did. So when I entered college,
                                I specifically looked for karate clubs, and found the Nihon Karate Club. As an exercise routine,
                                training in karate helped my physical and mental health,
                                and participating in the club gave me a great social community.
                                Training has been a way for me to practice discipline and perseverance.
                                It has given me confidence and skills that have carried into my personal and professional life.

                                I have also had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of students: children, college students,
                                adults. I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with people and share their training.

                                I started my journey in Karate during my first year at UCI.
                                My prior background was in Muay Thai, so Karate was a way of testing new waters.
                                For over eight years, I have enjoyed training with Sensei Bruce, Sensei Chad, and Sensei Ray,
                                competing and being a part of the UCI Karate family.
                                I earned my first-degree black belt in Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; style in 2017.
                                <br><br>
                                Karate, and to a huge extent martial arts in general, has been a great source of learning for me.
                                I have learned to strengthen and disciple both mind and body, to continuously adapt,
                                to persevere and have the courage and ability to protect the ones I care about.
                                During my training, I have also had the opportunity to teach kids and adults alike,
                                and impart the same knowledge that was once bestowed upon me.

                                The martial arts have always captivated me since childhood.
                                I grew up watching action movies at every opportunity.
                                It was not until age 12 when I was finally able to pursue study of my own through
                                Aikikai under Tenshinkai founder and head instructor Sensei Dang Thong Phong.
                                <br><br>
                                Later on when my college studies precluded my continued training with Sensei Phong,
                                I took it as an opportunity to learn something new.
                                That was when I met Sensei Bruce Nguyen and Chad Eagan through the UC Irvine Nihon Karate class and club.
                                Little did I know then, but Karate eventually became and continues to be an essential part of my adult life.
                                Not only has it improved my fitness and stress management skills,
                                but some of my closest friends have been made through Karate.
                                <br><br>
                                What I value most about Karate is its simplicity.
                                When complexities are abound in the world around us,
                                having a constant source of simplicity helps placate all other aspects of life.

                                Karate teaches me to maintain good balance in life and to hold a strong mentality when faced with challenges.

								Hi! I’m a 3rd-year student at UCI, majoring in Political Science and Civil Engineering.
								<br><br>
								I started karate in my freshman year. I had done karate in middle school, and I was 
								determined to give it another try.  
								The karate club has been an amazing experience for me! In addition to improving my 
								self-defense skills, I've met so many amazing people and had several opportunities
								to travel and expand my horizons. 
								Karate has been a great way to relieve school stress and get more exercise, and I'm
								excited to see what this year holds.

								I started karate in the middle of my second year with no previous experience. 
								When I started sparring, I had no idea what I was doing, but eventually, it started to click. Since then, I've 
								been even more excited to continue training. I joined the board as Fundraising Chair and was able 
								to connect with the community through fundraising and make some great friends in the club. 
								I hope this year goes well too!

                                Hi! My name is Nicole Florence and I'm currently a second year at UCI. My major is Economics and I'm also pursing a minor in Philosophy.
								<br><br>
								Joining the karate club at UCI was a fairly spontaneous decision of mine. 
								I had no idea what to expect or what was expected of me, 
								but it turned out to be one of the best decsions I made my first year. 
								I came in with no prior training, only an open mind and eagerness to be active. 
								Quickly I learned that this sport is not only about physical activity, 
								but also discipline and close connects. For me, NKC offered an outlet to venture out of my comfort zone, 
								a place to release my stress, and most importantly a home away from my home.
