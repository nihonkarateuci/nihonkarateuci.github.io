                                    During my university years I had the opportunity to travel to Japan
                                    and train at the honbu dojo of JKA and received instruction from Kurihara Kazuaki,

                                    I started Shotokan Karate back in 1999 in Brittany, France, attracted by my father's old VHS of combat training. 
                                    After getting my black belt I realized that I was just getting started, and that there would never be an ending to improving my karate. 
                                    This aspect of karate is extremely humbling and exciting to me as there will always be more to do, to learn.
                                    Having the chance to teach karate to young kids for 4 years was extremely rewarding to be able to pass on skills and see the growth in them. 
                                    Moving to different places and country and being curious, I broadened my martial arts practice with jotaikido jutsu and systema. 
                                    Arriving here in Irvine, I was extremely happy to find Sensei Bruce and discovering the practice of Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773;. 
                                    Having recently got a 2nd Dan I am looking forward to dive deeper into this style and share my passion with new practitioners.

                                    I started training as a white belt when I began college at UC Irvine in 2010, 
                                    and now I have a 1st degree black belt with Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; Karate. 
                                    When I was a child, I took a month of karate lessons. 
                                    I always wanted to continue, but never did. So when I entered college, 
                                    I specifically looked for karate clubs, and found the Nihon Karate Club. As an exercise routine, 
                                    training in karate helped my physical and mental health, 
                                    and participating in the club gave me a great social community. 
                                    Training has been a way for me to practice discipline and perseverance. 
                                    It has given me confidence and skills that have carried into my personal and professional life.

                                    Training with the Nihon Karate club and Jinen-Kai, 
                                    I have also had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of students: children, college students,
                                     adults. I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with people and share their training.

                                    The martial arts have always captivated me since childhood. 
                                    I grew up watching action movies at every opportunity. 
                                    It was not until age 12 when I was finally able to pursue study of my own through 
                                    Aikikai under Tenshinkai founder and head instructor Sensei Dang Thong Phong.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Later on when my college studies precluded my continued training with Sensei Phong, 
                                    I took it as an opportunity to learn something new. 
                                    That was when I met Sensei Bruce Nguyen and Chad Eagan through the UC Irvine Nihon Karate class and club. 
                                    Little did I know then, but Karate eventually became and continues to be an essential part of my adult life. 
                                    Not only has it improved my fitness and stress management skills, 
                                    but some of my closest friends have been made through Karate.

                                    What I value most about Karate is its simplicity. 
                                    When complexities are abound in the world around us, 
                                    having a constant source of simplicity helps placate all other aspects of life.

                                    During my university years I had the opportunity to travel to Japan
                                    and train at the honbu dojo of JKA and received instruction from Kurihara Kazuaki,

                                    I started Shotokan Karate back in 1999 in Brittany, France, attracted by my father's old VHS of combat training. 
                                    After getting my black belt I realized that I was just getting started, and that there would never be an ending to improving my karate. 
                                    This aspect of karate is extremely humbling and exciting to me as there will always be more to do, to learn.
                                    Having the chance to teach karate to young kids for 4 years was extremely rewarding to be able to pass on skills and see the growth in them. 
                                    Moving to different places and country and being curious, I broadened my martial arts practice with jotaikido jutsu and systema. 
                                    Arriving here in Irvine, I was extremely happy to find Sensei Bruce and discovering the practice of Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773;. 
                                    Having recently got a 2nd Dan I am looking forward to dive deeper into this style and share my passion with new practitioners.

                                    I started training as a white belt when I began college at UC Irvine in 2010, 
                                    and now I have a 1st degree black belt with Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; Karate. 
                                    When I was a child, I took a month of karate lessons. 
                                    I always wanted to continue, but never did. So when I entered college, 
                                    I specifically looked for karate clubs, and found the Nihon Karate Club. As an exercise routine, 
                                    training in karate helped my physical and mental health, 
                                    and participating in the club gave me a great social community. 
                                    Training has been a way for me to practice discipline and perseverance. 
                                    It has given me confidence and skills that have carried into my personal and professional life.

                                    Training with the Nihon Karate club and Jinen-Kai, 
                                    I have also had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of students: children, college students,
                                     adults. I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with people and share their training.

                                    The martial arts have always captivated me since childhood. 
                                    I grew up watching action movies at every opportunity. 
                                    It was not until age 12 when I was finally able to pursue study of my own through 
                                    Aikikai under Tenshinkai founder and head instructor Sensei Dang Thong Phong.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Later on when my college studies precluded my continued training with Sensei Phong, 
                                    I took it as an opportunity to learn something new. 
                                    That was when I met Sensei Bruce Nguyen and Chad Eagan through the UC Irvine Nihon Karate class and club. 
                                    Little did I know then, but Karate eventually became and continues to be an essential part of my adult life. 
                                    Not only has it improved my fitness and stress management skills, 
                                    but some of my closest friends have been made through Karate.
                                    <br><br>
                                    What I value most about Karate is its simplicity. 
                                    When complexities are abound in the world around us, 
                                    having a constant source of simplicity helps placate all other aspects of life.

                                    Started Karate in 2010 as a Freshman at UCI.
                                    Obtained current rank (1st kyu) in Dec. 2018.
                                    Karate teaches me balance and strong mental mentality when faced with life's challenges.
