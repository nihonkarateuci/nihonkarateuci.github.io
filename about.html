                                During my university years I had the opportunity to travel to Japan
                                and train at the honbu dojo of JKA and received instruction from Kurihara Kazuaki,
                                Naka Tatsuya, Kunio Kobayashi, and other great senseis.

                                I started Shotokan Karate back in 1999 in Brittany, France, attracted by my father's old VHS of combat training.
                                After getting my black belt I realized that I was just getting started, and that there would never be an ending to improving my karate.
                                This aspect of karate is extremely humbling and exciting to me as there will always be more to do, to learn.
                                Having the chance to teach karate to young kids for 4 years was extremely rewarding to be able to pass on skills and see the growth in them.
                                Moving to different places and country and being curious, I broadened my martial arts practice with jotaikido jutsu and systema.
                                Arriving here in Irvine, I was extremely happy to find Sensei Bruce and discovering the practice of Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773;.
                                Having recently got a 2nd Dan I am looking forward to dive deeper into this style and share my passion with new practitioners.

                                I started training as a white belt when I began college at UC Irvine in 2010,
                                and now I have a 1st degree black belt with Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; Karate.
                                When I was a child, I took a month of karate lessons.
                                I always wanted to continue, but never did. So when I entered college,
                                I specifically looked for karate clubs, and found the Nihon Karate Club. As an exercise routine,
                                training in karate helped my physical and mental health,
                                and participating in the club gave me a great social community.
                                Training has been a way for me to practice discipline and perseverance.
                                It has given me confidence and skills that have carried into my personal and professional life.

                                I have also had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of students: children, college students,
                                adults. I am grateful for the opportunity to connect with people and share their training.

                                I started my journey in Karate during my first year at UCI.
                                My prior background was in Muay Thai, so Karate was a way of testing new waters.
                                For over eight years, I have enjoyed training with Sensei Bruce, Sensei Chad, and Sensei Ray,
                                competing and being a part of the UCI Karate family.
                                I earned my first-degree black belt in Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; style in 2017.
                                <br><br>
                                Karate, and to a huge extent martial arts in general, has been a great source of learning for me.
                                I have learned to strengthen and disciple both mind and body, to continuously adapt,
                                to persevere and have the courage and ability to protect the ones I care about.
                                During my training, I have also had the opportunity to teach kids and adults alike,
                                and impart the same knowledge that was once bestowed upon me.

                                The martial arts have always captivated me since childhood.
                                I grew up watching action movies at every opportunity.
                                It was not until age 12 when I was finally able to pursue study of my own through
                                Aikikai under Tenshinkai founder and head instructor Sensei Dang Thong Phong.
                                <br><br>
                                Later on when my college studies precluded my continued training with Sensei Phong,
                                I took it as an opportunity to learn something new.
                                That was when I met Sensei Bruce Nguyen and Chad Eagan through the UC Irvine Nihon Karate class and club.
                                Little did I know then, but Karate eventually became and continues to be an essential part of my adult life.
                                Not only has it improved my fitness and stress management skills,
                                but some of my closest friends have been made through Karate.
                                <br><br>
                                What I value most about Karate is its simplicity.
                                When complexities are abound in the world around us,
                                having a constant source of simplicity helps placate all other aspects of life.

                                Karate teaches me to maintain good balance in life and to hold a strong mentality when faced with challenges.

                                I started karate in my first year with no previous experience in martial arts. I had always wanted to learn to fight,
                                and after seeing a demonstration of karate at the ARC I decided to join Nihon Karate Club at UCI. At first I was just trying
                                it out to see if I would enjoy it, but now karate has become one of my passions in life. Every time I attend a training, I feel
                                like I’m making a step towards becoming a better and stronger person. The community is very welcoming, and I have been learning a
                                lot from Sensei Bruce Nguyen and all of the others who also pursue karate. I hope to continue training throughout college, and I am
                                grateful to be part of the karate community.

                                <br><br>
                                I first started practicing Karate in January 2007, under the Shotokan style.
                                I am currently a shodan in that style.
                                <br><br>
                                Joining karate at UCI and training in Shindo&#773; Jinen-Ryu&#773; Karate has been an amazing experience.
                                Learning karate from a completely different angle has granted me new insight into my own strengths
                                and weaknesses, and having the opportunity to share my passion for karate with individuals
                                equally motivated and driven as myself has helped me improve a great deal. I hope to
                                continue to foster this spirit in our club throughout this school year.

                                with numerous people with similar passions and talents within the club and thoroughly enjoy the companionship and team
                                effort the club provides. I am excited to continue my journey in karate and build more experiences in the coming school year.

                                I joined the Nihon Karate Club in my first year at UCI because I wanted to get back into karate after my 4-year hiatus of doing color guard.
                                I didn’t attend practice frequently at first, but I started to after I decided to enter a tournament. I was able to improve my rusty technique
                                and learn a new style of karate. During this time, I started becoming more comfortable and created bonds with the other members in the club.
                                I enjoy having this community of people with diverse backgrounds who come together to practice an art and learn to protect ourselves. I’m looking
                                forward to sharing more of these experiences with everyone!
