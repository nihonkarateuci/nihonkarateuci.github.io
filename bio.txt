I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major at UCI.
I started training karate in January 2007, under the Shotokan style.
I received my Shodan in June 2018.
Joining karate at UCI was an interesting experience for me,
having to learn a completely different style of karate, but it has been
pretty great so far.
